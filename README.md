# Match The Member #

Match the Member is the mini-project 1 for UC Berkeley's Mobile Developers of Berkeley. The main objective
is to learn the name of the members. Thus, an image will appear on the home screen with four name options.
If the player is correct, he or she will earn a point. If not, no points will be added.
